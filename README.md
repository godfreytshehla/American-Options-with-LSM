BSc (Hons) in Advanced Mathematics of Finance Research Project conducted from 1 June to 30 November 2017.
The research project covers the pricing of American options using the Longstaff and Schwartz method and is compared with Bjerksund and Stensland approximation and the Binomial tree model.

This is still one of my active areas of research.
